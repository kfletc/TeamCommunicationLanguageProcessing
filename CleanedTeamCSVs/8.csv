59,6.0,1,00:00:59.176000,i guess when there arent fires and we are just waiting around wait near the middle?,2,127,31,28,34,34
60,6.0,4,00:01:09.713000,giving certain people houses and others forest instead?,2,127,31,28,34,34
61,4.0,2,00:01:34.611000,we can't just all wait in the middle. then the sections aren't covered,2,127,31,28,34,34

72,6.0,2,00:04:08.710000,i'm getting a truck since i was assigned it. how are we going to divide up the map? and being divided with two hellis and two tucks gives us diversity in handling the situation,2,127,31,28,34,34
