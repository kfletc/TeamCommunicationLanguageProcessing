0,6.0,2,00:02:14.453000,we need to divide up into sections,0,147,38,47,35,27
1,,4,00:02:40.066000,agreed,0,147,38,47,35,27
2,4.0,1,00:02:40.681000,helicopters top,0,147,38,47,35,27
3,4.0,3,00:03:01.068000,truck right lower,0,147,38,47,35,27
4,5.0,2,00:03:18.640000,helicopters should get the north village and two left woods. trucks will get rest,0,147,38,47,35,27
5,,3,00:03:46.794000,works for me,0,147,38,47,35,27
6,,4,00:04:04.319000,okay got it,0,147,38,47,35,27
7,,1,00:04:25.136000,sounds good,0,147,38,47,35,27
8,,2,00:05:43.176000,some raging forest fires going on right now yall,0,147,38,47,35,27
9,,2,00:05:51.006000,not,0,147,38,47,35,27
10,,1,00:05:56.776000,so exciting,0,147,38,47,35,27
11,,3,00:06:16.433000,yeah. Where is a zerg rush when you need it,0,147,38,47,35,27
12,,1,00:06:35.594000,this is my favorite game,0,147,38,47,35,27
13,,3,00:06:56.508000,one of my favorites as well.,0,147,38,47,35,27
14,,1,00:08:35.001000,it got exciting,0,147,38,47,35,27
15,,3,00:08:44.935000,for a minute,0,147,38,47,35,27
16,6.0,2,00:09:19.770000,maybe there should be a helipcopter per section. theyre faster,0,147,38,47,35,27
17,6.0,3,00:00:25.713000,let us divide the grid,1,147,38,47,35,27
18,4.0,2,00:00:32.557000,one chopper and firetruck together?,1,147,38,47,35,27
19,,1,00:00:40.743000,upper right,1,147,38,47,35,27
20,,2,00:00:43.960000,down the middle?,1,147,38,47,35,27
21,,3,00:01:10.863000,truck lower right,1,147,38,47,35,27
22,,3,00:01:12.792000,,1,147,38,47,35,27
23,,2,00:02:31.177000,crap,1,147,38,47,35,27
24,,4,00:02:48.563000,fail,1,147,38,47,35,27
25,,3,00:03:07.490000,this is goint to be fun.,1,147,38,47,35,27
26,,1,00:03:13.208000,yeah the tanks run out too fast,1,147,38,47,35,27
27,,1,00:04:44.102000,this sucks,1,147,38,47,35,27
28,,2,00:05:12.020000,guess we shouldnt have made fun of the training,1,147,38,47,35,27
29,,3,00:06:10.219000,indeed,1,147,38,47,35,27
30,,1,00:06:22.322000,true.,1,147,38,47,35,27
31,4.0,2,00:06:49.637000,is there four of us? i only see three vehicles,1,147,38,47,35,27
32,,2,00:07:04.710000,never mind,1,147,38,47,35,27
33,,3,00:09:47.035000,temp rising expect something,1,147,38,47,35,27
34,,2,00:12:14.424000,oh crap,1,147,38,47,35,27
35,,4,00:12:23.311000,ummmmm...,1,147,38,47,35,27
36,,3,00:12:54.855000,...,1,147,38,47,35,27
37,,1,00:13:07.655000,idk if it would have been possible to contain that,1,147,38,47,35,27
38,,4,00:13:21.851000,definitely not,1,147,38,47,35,27
39,3.0,2,00:13:24.600000,i dont have a compass or anything so i dont know the temp or wind...,1,147,38,47,35,27
40,,2,00:13:47.120000,top right,1,147,38,47,35,27
41,,3,00:13:55.800000,move positions up where there is still green,1,147,38,47,35,27
42,,1,00:14:18.149000,top,1,147,38,47,35,27
43,6.0,2,00:14:20.296000,i gotta protec the one house down here,1,147,38,47,35,27
44,,2,00:00:20.550000,did we ask for information?,2,147,38,47,35,27
45,,1,00:00:30.910000,not really just gave it mostly,2,147,38,47,35,27
46,,4,00:00:38.481000,not really. we just told each other where things were,2,147,38,47,35,27
47,,3,00:00:38.670000,Yeah,2,147,38,47,35,27
48,,1,00:00:51.889000,was it organized?,2,147,38,47,35,27
49,,2,00:00:54.469000,i think as soon as we saw the problems we communicated and reacted,2,147,38,47,35,27
50,,4,00:01:02.968000,somewhat organized,2,147,38,47,35,27
51,,2,00:01:08.524000,it couldve been more organized but it was,2,147,38,47,35,27
52,,1,00:01:11.963000,yeah we tried,2,147,38,47,35,27
53,,3,00:01:20.221000,We tried,2,147,38,47,35,27
54,6.0,2,00:01:40.099000,we need to try and divide the sections more evenly,2,147,38,47,35,27
55,,1,00:01:42.376000,the helicopters hold less water than the trucks,2,147,38,47,35,27
56,,3,00:01:52.189000,but they move faster,2,147,38,47,35,27
57,,4,00:01:57.037000,we should try to give trucks less space to cover than the helicopters too,2,147,38,47,35,27
58,,1,00:01:58.518000,true.,2,147,38,47,35,27
59,6.0,3,00:02:19.497000,Should likely pair them up somewhat.,2,147,38,47,35,27
60,,2,00:02:32.580000,if we make the map a grid then it would be easier.,2,147,38,47,35,27
61,,4,00:02:35.064000,yeah thats a good idea. instead of having everyone going everywhere,2,147,38,47,35,27
62,4.0,1,00:02:43.161000,yeah a helicopter and truck on each side,2,147,38,47,35,27
63,,4,00:02:51.868000,down the middle?,2,147,38,47,35,27
64,4.0,3,00:02:53.788000,That way the trucks are there to cover while the copters refuel.,2,147,38,47,35,27
65,6.0,2,00:03:13.712000,down the middle for the pairs and then top and bottom for each side i think,2,147,38,47,35,27
66,,1,00:03:14.389000,this is a huge map,2,147,38,47,35,27
67,,4,00:03:23.741000,yeah that was a big problem. the whole refueling thing,2,147,38,47,35,27
68,,2,00:03:29.344000,its the same as the other just flipped,2,147,38,47,35,27
69,,3,00:03:33.103000,I would say vertically would be best,2,147,38,47,35,27
70,,2,00:04:26.377000,so a truck and chopper go to the right of the middle house in the woods,2,147,38,47,35,27
71,,1,00:04:27.344000,so what splits it?,2,147,38,47,35,27
72,,3,00:04:55.285000,Yeah.,2,147,38,47,35,27
73,6.0,2,00:05:02.181000,you think vertically would be easier to manage than horizontally?,2,147,38,47,35,27
74,3.0,4,00:05:34.780000,i think both ways would work,2,147,38,47,35,27
75,6.0,3,00:05:47.836000,put the copters in the forest since that is where it looks like they start more and the trucks on the outskirts.,2,147,38,47,35,27
76,,1,00:06:03.759000,that sounds good,2,147,38,47,35,27
77,6.0,3,00:06:26.526000,The copters hit as soon as they pop up & cover while the truck moves into position & covers while the copter refuels.,2,147,38,47,35,27
78,6.0,2,00:06:27.891000,we just need to try and contain the edges of the fires when they start to spread,2,147,38,47,35,27
79,,4,00:06:41.115000,yeah that sounds good,2,147,38,47,35,27
80,,1,00:06:47.489000,we can try that,2,147,38,47,35,27
81,6.0,4,00:07:00.640000,so helicopters in the middle then?,2,147,38,47,35,27
82,,1,00:07:05.839000,yeha,2,147,38,47,35,27
83,4.0,3,00:07:07.940000,That way if it gets too big we can converge like we did with that monster last time.,2,147,38,47,35,27
84,,4,00:07:18.444000,alrighty,2,147,38,47,35,27
85,,2,00:07:20.579000,if it looks like its heading for an already burnt out area just leave it.,2,147,38,47,35,27
86,,1,00:07:31.315000,ok,2,147,38,47,35,27
87,,2,00:07:38.128000,i love this game. i play it at home all the time,2,147,38,47,35,27
88,,3,00:07:43.518000,Yeah once it is burnt it should stop.,2,147,38,47,35,27
89,,1,00:07:49.568000,me too,2,147,38,47,35,27
90,,1,00:08:05.892000,better than any other game in the world,2,147,38,47,35,27
91,,3,00:08:22.205000,That way when our zones decrease & we do not have to worry as the game progresses.,2,147,38,47,35,27
92,,1,00:08:26.394000,y'all ready? 2 min 30 sec,2,147,38,47,35,27
93,,4,00:08:55.142000,so ready,2,147,38,47,35,27
94,,2,00:09:09.285000,the trucls have a fuel level too. if you drive too much youll run out,2,147,38,47,35,27
95,,2,00:09:23.206000,i was born ready for this,2,147,38,47,35,27
96,3.0,3,00:09:41.337000,Yeah I noticed that. Surprised the copters do not.,2,147,38,47,35,27
97,5.0,1,00:09:44.819000,so does helicopter but I dont think that will be a problem\,2,147,38,47,35,27
98,3.0,4,00:09:48.574000,the copters do too,2,147,38,47,35,27
99,,1,00:10:01.873000,lets go,3,147,38,47,35,27
100,4.0,2,00:10:06.062000,no wind gauge again,3,147,38,47,35,27
101,,3,00:10:38.253000,Wind direction is in the top.,3,147,38,47,35,27
102,3.0,4,00:10:41.499000,i dont have one this time,3,147,38,47,35,27
103,,1,00:10:50.049000,north,3,147,38,47,35,27
104,3.0,2,00:10:52.389000,it doesnt appear for some people,3,147,38,47,35,27
105,,4,00:11:03.838000,lovely,3,147,38,47,35,27
106,,2,00:11:48.620000,well okay,3,147,38,47,35,27
107,,4,00:11:56.658000,that was a great start,3,147,38,47,35,27
108,,1,00:12:01.232000,which ever direction the wind is blowing get that side of the fire first,3,147,38,47,35,27
109,4.0,2,00:13:33.638000,theres just a random truck and two choppers in the middle woods.,3,147,38,47,35,27
110,,2,00:13:38.660000,soth,3,147,38,47,35,27
111,,4,00:13:48.717000,yeah what is that,3,147,38,47,35,27
112,3.0,1,00:14:17.214000,im in the woods with a copter,3,147,38,47,35,27
113,,3,00:14:17.575000,Think someone might have accidentally grabbed all of them & not realized it,3,147,38,47,35,27
114,3.0,2,00:14:23.323000,if you type without clicking it selects vehicles,3,147,38,47,35,27
115,,2,00:14:31.469000,i just did it by accident,3,147,38,47,35,27
116,,4,00:14:38.084000,ooohh i think i did that earlier,3,147,38,47,35,27
117,4.0,3,00:14:57.563000,I am in the lower left corner in the truck.,3,147,38,47,35,27
118,4.0,2,00:15:09.920000,top right truck,3,147,38,47,35,27
119,,3,00:15:26.728000,wind south east.,3,147,38,47,35,27
120,6.0,1,00:15:50.841000,i think if you click while moving it goes a little faster,3,147,38,47,35,27
121,,2,00:17:48.352000,i love acciently letting hundreds of acres of land burn to the groung,3,147,38,47,35,27
122,,2,00:18:12.005000,all those poor peoples homes,3,147,38,47,35,27
123,,1,00:18:17.616000,sucks,3,147,38,47,35,27
124,,3,00:18:20.656000,yep,3,147,38,47,35,27
125,,1,00:18:33.254000,I think its impossible to be good at this game,3,147,38,47,35,27
126,,3,00:18:43.066000,At least it did not consume the water tank,3,147,38,47,35,27
127,,2,00:19:01.017000,i would quit if that could happen,3,147,38,47,35,27
128,,4,00:19:09.209000,yep same here,3,147,38,47,35,27

130,,1,00:19:25.153000,temp is going up,3,147,38,47,35,27
131,3.0,3,00:19:32.944000,Well my question is what do you do if you run out of gas.,3,147,38,47,35,27
132,,2,00:19:39.311000,die,3,147,38,47,35,27
133,3.0,3,00:20:13.796000,My wind direction & temp gauge just disappeared.,3,147,38,47,35,27
134,3.0,2,00:20:25.763000,at least you had one to start,3,147,38,47,35,27
135,,4,00:20:27.337000,well thats unfortunate,3,147,38,47,35,27
136,,2,00:21:44.721000,well then,3,147,38,47,35,27

140,,2,00:22:58.295000,two less houses to worry about,3,147,38,47,35,27
141,,4,00:23:23.898000,...i hate this game,3,147,38,47,35,27
142,,3,00:23:33.415000,Yeah why build your house out there anyway unless you are an arsonist?,3,147,38,47,35,27
143,,1,00:23:34.011000,half of the trees are gone noooo,3,147,38,47,35,27
144,,4,00:23:52.403000,its a conspiracy,3,147,38,47,35,27
145,3.0,2,00:24:05.453000,im at half fuel,3,147,38,47,35,27
146,,2,00:24:58.955000,good work yall,3,147,38,47,35,27
147,4.0,2,00:02:14.453000,we need to divide up into sections,0,147,38,47,35,27
148,4.0,2,00:03:18.640000,helicopters should get the north village and two left woods. trucks will get rest,0,147,38,47,35,27
149,4.0,2,00:09:19.770000,maybe there should be a helipcopter per section. theyre faster,0,147,38,47,35,27
150,4.0,3,00:00:25.713000,let us divide the grid,1,147,38,47,35,27
151,4.0,2,00:14:20.296000,i gotta protec the one house down here,1,147,38,47,35,27
152,4.0,2,00:01:40.099000,we need to try and divide the sections more evenly,2,147,38,47,35,27
153,4.0,3,00:02:19.497000,Should likely pair them up somewhat.,2,147,38,47,35,27
154,4.0,2,00:03:13.712000,down the middle for the pairs and then top and bottom for each side i think,2,147,38,47,35,27
155,4.0,3,00:05:47.836000,put the copters in the forest since that is where it looks like they start more and the trucks on the outskirts.,2,147,38,47,35,27

158,4.0,4,00:07:00.640000,so helicopters in the middle then?,2,147,38,47,35,27
159,3.0,1,00:09:44.819000,so does helicopter but I dont think that will be a problem\,2,147,38,47,35,27
160,3.0,1,00:15:50.841000,i think if you click while moving it goes a little faster,3,147,38,47,35,27
