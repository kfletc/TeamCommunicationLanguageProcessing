20,,3,00:01:07.172000,i think we did a good job we used the chat board well. and we organized ourselves into areas on the map.,2,93,14,27,24,28
21,,4,00:01:07.946000,So we answered info by this cha box,2,93,14,27,24,28
22,6.0,2,00:01:13.543000,Yea I'm thinking we just basically said where the fire was after spreading out in certain areas around the map.  Sounds easy enough.,2,93,14,27,24,28
23,,4,00:01:37.902000,Yea I think we organized ourselves good,2,93,14,27,24,28

32,6.0,4,00:03:37.114000,We can improve I guess by satying in our sections.. then only if we have no fires then help someone that does. because we all cant rush to the same fire if it isnt that big,2,93,14,27,24,28
