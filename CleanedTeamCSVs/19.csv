15,6.0,3.0,00:06:58.898000,I think the trucks move slower than the helicopters so they should probably be closer to the refueling station,0,135,19,43,35,38
16,,2.0,00:07:11.695000,yeah agreed,0,135,19,43,35,38

25,6.0,3.0,00:00:26.114000,Helicopters need to cover the center forest,1,135,19,43,35,38
26,6.0,2.0,00:00:30.793000,so i believe that the helicopters should scout and look for fire and slowly hit some small fires while the fire engines chase the helicopter and put out the file while working in a sections,1,135,19,43,35,38
27,6.0,2.0,00:01:04.674000,helicopters will reduce the fire from spreading and fire trucks will finish the fire off,1,135,19,43,35,38
28,,4.0,00:03:29.044000,nice work,1,135,19,43,35,38

42,6.0,3.0,00:13:10.634000,well atleast we don't have to watch the bottom half of the map now,1,135,19,43,35,38
43,,2.0,00:13:17.864000,this is like fire fighting in colorados fires,1,135,19,43,35,38
44,,1.0,00:13:23.978000,what about the few houses,1,135,19,43,35,38
45,,4.0,00:14:45.975000,dang global warming,1,135,19,43,35,38
46,6.0,2.0,00:00:00,Alright now so the helicopters should be on the outside of fires and then the fire engines be on the inside of the fire since they are stronger,2,135,19,43,35,38
47,,4.0,00:00:30.022000,hello,2,135,19,43,35,38
48,,2.0,00:00:31.182000,also we should alternate as 1 vehicle in and then 1 vehicle out,2,135,19,43,35,38
49,6.0,4.0,00:00:45.668000,watch the windage,2,135,19,43,35,38
50,6.0,2.0,00:00:50.646000,that way we are constantly refueled in order to put fires out,2,135,19,43,35,38
51,,4.0,00:01:02.523000,i agree,2,135,19,43,35,38
52,6.0,3.0,00:01:04.142000,Should it not be the goal of everyone to be on the outside of fires? That way we prevent it from spreading farther?,2,135,19,43,35,38
53,,1.0,00:01:21.709000,correct,2,135,19,43,35,38
54,,2.0,00:01:28.123000,that would be useful considering the fact that the fire on the inside would smother itself,2,135,19,43,35,38
55,6.0,4.0,00:01:30.743000,yes start outside in the direction of the wind,2,135,19,43,35,38
56,,3.0,00:01:37.815000,agreed,2,135,19,43,35,38

62,,1.0,00:02:51.104000,when houses and forests on fire protect houses first?,2,135,19,43,35,38
63,6.0,3.0,00:02:53.266000,it seems like it takes everyone to put out a fire,2,135,19,43,35,38
64,,4.0,00:02:59.162000,yeah im not convienced thats the best way,2,135,19,43,35,38
65,6.0,2.0,00:03:03.324000,i would say we move in a clockwise pattern or something like that,2,135,19,43,35,38
