56,3,00:01:41.175000,I view proffessional success as everything you do that brings you closer to the goals that you set for yourself.,2,,141,36,22,51,32
57,1,00:01:51.650000,I agree.,2,,141,36,22,51,32

62,4,00:02:42.169000,I agree with conduct,2,,141,36,22,51,32
63,2,00:02:45.572000,professionally in the workplace,2,,141,36,22,51,32
64,4,00:03:10.215000,It's about getting to your goals but not being a total jerk about it or finding shady shortcuts,2,,141,36,22,51,32
65,3,00:03:16.095000,i guess conditions are the sorts of things that need to be in place for you to succeed,2,,141,36,22,51,32
66,2,00:03:26.020000,The way you go about reaching your goals,2,,141,36,22,51,32
67,4,00:03:31.001000,yes,2,,141,36,22,51,32
68,3,00:03:49.350000,like you can't have professional success without: drive or reason,2,,141,36,22,51,32
69,1,00:03:51.192000,So as a team we could defined Professional success as conditions that you must meet as a means of meeting your goals,2,,141,36,22,51,32
70,3,00:04:01.329000,I agree with that.,2,,141,36,22,51,32
71,2,00:04:05.800000,I agree as well,2,,141,36,22,51,32
72,4,00:04:41.031000,Improving professional success..... Knowing more about your goals and the means to reach those goals....,2,,141,36,22,51,32
73,2,00:05:30.102000,Yes being well informed as to what it would take for you to accomplish what you set out to do,2,,141,36,22,51,32
74,3,00:05:30.941000,you can improve proffessinal success by setting clear goals having a timetable of some sort to follow determining your reasoning full considering the pros and cons of situations,2,,141,36,22,51,32
75,1,00:05:39.959000,Some conditions may include: organization knowledge about your field of study drive etc. ,2,,141,36,22,51,32
76,2,00:05:55.612000,I would say the people you know too,2,,141,36,22,51,32

79,1,00:06:11.422000,yes that plays a big role as well,2,,141,36,22,51,32
80,4,00:06:18.557000,Yes there is nothing like a  good group of people to help you along and keep you in line.,2,,141,36,22,51,32
81,1,00:06:37.772000,so positive reinforcement,2,,141,36,22,51,32
82,2,00:06:48.379000,yes and self-discipline,2,,141,36,22,51,32
83,3,00:06:48.727000,also money. let's be real: it's hard to get anywhere without it. no matter how good your intentions are or how smart you are.,2,,141,36,22,51,32

86,1,00:07:00.734000,very true,2,,141,36,22,51,32
87,1,00:07:48.890000,to improve i would say you need to have clear goals and set of tasks that will help you to obtain that goal.,2,,141,36,22,51,32
88,2,00:07:49.357000,I would also say being aware of what is required to stay competetive in your feild,2,,141,36,22,51,32
89,3,00:08:11.510000,right. you can easily fall behind if you don't stay informed,2,,141,36,22,51,32
90,4,00:08:27.358000,So basically use all your resources. resources include everything around you. Sitations people things idea really everything. knowing what you have makes a world of difference,2,,141,36,22,51,32
91,3,00:08:41.592000,that sums it up.,2,,141,36,22,51,32
