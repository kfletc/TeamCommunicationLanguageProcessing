0,5.0,1.0,00:01:56.318000,are we going to assign little quadrants?,0,90,20,18,31,21
1,,3.0,00:02:08.604000,that sounds good to me,0,90,20,18,31,21
2,5.0,1.0,00:03:20.972000,I will takie the forest on the bottom left,0,90,20,18,31,21
3,5.0,2.0,00:04:17.605000,I can take the one on the bottom right,0,90,20,18,31,21
4,5.0,3.0,00:04:41.071000,I will take the village in the bottom right,0,90,20,18,31,21
5,6.0,1.0,00:04:59.305000,So that leaves 3 has the top forest and village,0,90,20,18,31,21
6,6.0,4.0,00:05:29.058000,I can take those at the top,0,90,20,18,31,21
7,6.0,3.0,00:05:36.066000,I can also be back up for the forest on the bottom right,0,90,20,18,31,21
8,5.0,1.0,00:06:04.499000,ill back up for the top forest,0,90,20,18,31,21
9,,3.0,00:09:06.605000,I think we got this,0,90,20,18,31,21
10,6.0,2.0,00:09:53.131000,If we need water we should message on here so that the backups can watch the sections until we get back,0,90,20,18,31,21
11,6.0,1.0,00:00:29.515000,okiay i have village on teh left and upper right portion of the big forest,1,90,20,18,31,21
12,6.0,3.0,00:00:29.837000,I have the lower part of the forest on the right and the small village,1,90,20,18,31,21
13,,2.0,00:00:36.571000,This map is a lot bigger than the last one,1,90,20,18,31,21
14,5.0,2.0,00:01:01.842000,I will take the top but just beware of the scale of the map...,1,90,20,18,31,21
15,6.0,4.0,00:01:03.033000,I can hover around in the middle and provide air support to all secotrs,1,90,20,18,31,21
16,6.0,3.0,00:01:08.280000,I will back up the whoever has the large forest.,1,90,20,18,31,21
17,4.0,1.0,00:01:10.236000,i mean middle portion of big forest,1,90,20,18,31,21
18,,2.0,00:01:58.573000,right side is on fire,1,90,20,18,31,21
19,,3.0,00:07:12.392000,everyone watch your fuel level on the right side of the screen,1,90,20,18,31,21
20,,1.0,00:09:04.470000,do we get fuel somwhere or swap vehicles,1,90,20,18,31,21
21,,2.0,00:09:42.849000,Also watch your health levels,1,90,20,18,31,21
22,,1.0,00:13:19.112000,that was really hard,1,90,20,18,31,21
23,,3.0,00:13:36.349000,there was no way to stop that,1,90,20,18,31,21
24,,1.0,00:00:51.435000,Are we answering the questions on here?,2,90,20,18,31,21
25,,4.0,00:01:00.636000,yep,2,90,20,18,31,21
26,4.0,2.0,00:01:10.403000,I think we did alright did people have their screens zoomed out so you could see the whole map??,2,90,20,18,31,21
27,,4.0,00:01:20.589000,I did,2,90,20,18,31,21
28,3.0,3.0,00:01:22.728000,The team passed on information by telling each other where fires were starting and also to watch out for our fuel levels and health levels and where to find that information,2,90,20,18,31,21
29,,1.0,00:02:11.695000,Okiay. Well I think that we communicated enough it was just way harder than we expected.,2,90,20,18,31,21
30,6.0,2.0,00:02:16.553000,I think having the screen all the way out helped because you could see not only your area but also other people that needed help. I know I'm going to do that again.,2,90,20,18,31,21
31,4.0,3.0,00:02:18.553000,we set up different sections for us to control and also inclduded back up for the other areas when we did not have fires in our own sections,2,90,20,18,31,21
32,,4.0,00:02:39.997000,I didn't think it was that bad,2,90,20,18,31,21
33,,4.0,00:02:54.189000,common sense stuff really,2,90,20,18,31,21
34,6.0,3.0,00:03:18.933000,I believe we can communicate a little better and when our fires get out of control we can type in that we need help and what area of the map we ned help in so back up can respond more quickly.,2,90,20,18,31,21
35,,3.0,00:03:21.946000,A,2,90,20,18,31,21
36,,2.0,00:03:51.107000,Do you think that there is a better way to try and extinguish the fires?,2,90,20,18,31,21
37,6.0,3.0,00:04:07.072000,Also it would be better if we alternated using the water tower that way we are not all rushing for them at the same time and someone is there to always manage the fires.,2,90,20,18,31,21
38,6.0,1.0,00:04:28.919000,We tried to divide it up. I know I tried to stay more at the left side and bottom. I think we are doing good pairing a helicopter with a fire truck. Instead i think we should have a helicopter and fire truck controlling the bottom half and a pair controlling the top. And if the fire is huge then two fire trucks and one helicopter.,2,90,20,18,31,21
39,,2.0,00:04:47.068000,I've noticed that if you can put out a big flame that some little ones will go out with that.,2,90,20,18,31,21
40,4.0,4.0,00:05:26.474000,Yeah pairing a bird with a truck seems ideal,2,90,20,18,31,21
41,4.0,2.0,00:05:38.941000,I've also noticed that the helicopters get there quicker so maybe they can work on the big flames first?,2,90,20,18,31,21
42,6.0,3.0,00:05:54,Something we can do in the next session of gaming is assign one helicopter and one fire engine to back up each other rather than the two fire engins backing each other and the two helicopters backing each other.,2,90,20,18,31,21
43,,3.0,00:06:47.947000,lol it seems as if we are all on the same page.,2,90,20,18,31,21
44,6.0,4.0,00:06:57.002000,Maybe slpit the areas the helicopters are assigned to. One to the lower half and one to the upper half of the map,2,90,20,18,31,21
45,6.0,1.0,00:07:32.615000,I thought we were pairing a fire engine with a helicopter. But the fire engines hold more water so if a fire breaks out and two can't control it another fire truck should come to the rescue and a helicopter can stay back just in case,2,90,20,18,31,21
46,4.0,2.0,00:07:46.270000,How are we going to designate areas on this map for trucks?,2,90,20,18,31,21
47,,3.0,00:07:47.126000,I have figured that helicopters move faster than the trucks but the trucks can put out more flames.,2,90,20,18,31,21
48,4.0,4.0,00:07:55.381000,and if anyone needs back up the helicopters can get there quicker,2,90,20,18,31,21
49,,4.0,00:08:24.752000,got about 2 minutes to figure out a game plan here,2,90,20,18,31,21
50,6.0,2.0,00:08:43.609000,We need to figure out where everyone's spots are?,2,90,20,18,31,21
51,4.0,1.0,00:08:52.770000,Idk. I just know that me as a helicopter does hardly anything for huge fires. I can get there but I dont last.,2,90,20,18,31,21
52,5.0,3.0,00:09:23.948000,we need to communicate what is going where so if I am a truck I will say I am going here that way everyone will know,2,90,20,18,31,21
53,4.0,4.0,00:09:40.251000,I'm a helicopter too but we can get there fast and at least provide some support,2,90,20,18,31,21
54,5.0,1.0,00:09:43.867000,Okay. I am a helicopter. I will be on the bottom half.,2,90,20,18,31,21
55,5.0,2.0,00:09:52.734000,I am a truck and I will be bottom half,2,90,20,18,31,21
56,6.0,3.0,00:09:58.015000,I'm a truck I can cover the top half,2,90,20,18,31,21
57,6.0,3.0,00:10:09.842000,we can all cover the middle section.,3,90,20,18,31,21
58,5.0,4.0,00:10:11.637000,I'm a helicopter and will cover the top half,3,90,20,18,31,21
59,4.0,1.0,00:10:29.571000,whoever is on the bottom half with me just commuicate with me to tell me where you are going,3,90,20,18,31,21
60,3.0,4.0,00:10:56.879000,do we have 4 trucks this time?,3,90,20,18,31,21
61,,2.0,00:11:19.367000,fires left corner,3,90,20,18,31,21
62,4.0,4.0,00:12:04.542000,yeah how do I have 4 vehicles now?,3,90,20,18,31,21

65,3.0,1.0,00:13:05.417000,I dont understand. Why are there doubles of everything,3,90,20,18,31,21
66,,4.0,00:13:23.549000,don't know but I'm rolling with it,3,90,20,18,31,21
67,,3.0,00:13:23.631000,not sure but it helps,3,90,20,18,31,21
68,3.0,4.0,00:15:00.282000,thanks I didn't see that,3,90,20,18,31,21
69,,3.0,00:15:06.802000,I got your back,3,90,20,18,31,21
70,4.0,3.0,00:16:18.926000,ohh it is two helicopters and two fire trucks.,3,90,20,18,31,21

75,,1.0,00:19:05.425000,next time we leave the forest behind and save the people,3,90,20,18,31,21
76,,2.0,00:19:33.536000,the house fires go out quicker and don't expand as quick as the forest,3,90,20,18,31,21
77,,3.0,00:19:58.062000,Way to back each other up,3,90,20,18,31,21
78,,1.0,00:20:15.097000,but its better to extinguish those. Rather lost forest than children.,3,90,20,18,31,21
79,,3.0,00:20:26.258000,yea this is true.,3,90,20,18,31,21
