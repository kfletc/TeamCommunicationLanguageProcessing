0,2,00:01:50.802000,Hello,0,,210,43,70,42,55
1,3,00:02:56.079000,Hi there,0,,210,43,70,42,55
2,1,00:05:12.967000,Hi back! ;-),0,,210,43,70,42,55
3,2,00:05:32.095000,So I can click on anything.,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
4,3,00:05:58.813000,I can't either. Apparently if you clicked before they said to then you don't get to play. Boo.,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
5,4,00:06:08.568000,Sitting here doing nothing cue the Jeopordy Music,0,,210,43,70,42,55
6,4,00:06:28.270000,I clicked after and I still dont get to play lol,0,,210,43,70,42,55
7,2,00:06:32.353000,Same here,0,,210,43,70,42,55
8,3,00:06:39.103000,Oh sorry read that wrong. Your sheet is supposed to tell you which vehicle to click.,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
9,4,00:07:09.308000,Yeah I'm the firetruck thats not moving,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
10,2,00:07:28.535000,I have a helicopter that may or may not be moving.,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
11,3,00:07:29.797000,Haha I'm the other firetruck that's not moving. I'm not sure what sitting here is supposed to be prove.,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
12,1,00:07:49.239000,I am the other heli,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
13,2,00:07:50.265000,I see moving helicopters and if I am moving it there is a delay,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
14,1,00:08:09.689000,looks like we can move stuff that we are not assigned to,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
15,1,00:08:20.186000,same for you?,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
16,2,00:08:52.571000,All of them just moved,0,,210,43,70,42,55
17,4,00:09:01.705000,I guess that we can be productive citizens without doing anything. So do we want to talk strategy since half the team cant move or wait until the real game? Everything is in ghost mode for me. They are moving but Im not touching them,0,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
18,3,00:09:04.920000,So do we move all of them now?,0,,210,43,70,42,55
19,3,00:09:42.696000,Sure might as well.,0,,210,43,70,42,55
20,2,00:09:44.812000,It may be part of the study to see how we react,0,,210,43,70,42,55
21,2,00:09:54.025000,And yes lets talk strategy,0,,210,43,70,42,55
22,4,00:10:00,Ha. I dont think they would do that to us. This is a team experiment. That seems kind of counter productive to me.,0,,210,43,70,42,55
23,4,00:10:00,I have no Idea. On the strategy thing  I think we should have one truck and copter on the top half and the other two on the bottom half,0,,210,43,70,42,55
24,2,00:00:00,So I am the right helicopter,1,4.0,210,43,70,42,55
25,4,00:00:05.662000,So i think we need to have the copters on the outside and the trucks on the inside,1,4.0,210,43,70,42,55

91,3,00:00:00,Left truck!,2,,210,43,70,42,55
92,3,00:00:00,Well let's chat shall we,2,,210,43,70,42,55
93,1,00:00:02.586000,ok,2,,210,43,70,42,55
94,2,00:00:18.462000,Question 1,2,,210,43,70,42,55
95,4,00:00:25.817000,So how do yall think we did,2,,210,43,70,42,55
96,4,00:00:55.749000,I think we did pretty good over all,2,,210,43,70,42,55
97,1,00:00:58.064000,liked that everybody was sharing what was noticed. like firetrucks take more water ...,2,,210,43,70,42,55
98,2,00:00:59.686000,I think we did well with cluing everyone in on where the fires where so that we could all get there,2,,210,43,70,42,55
99,3,00:01:24.428000,I think we did great letting everyone else know where fires were and who was going where,2,,210,43,70,42,55
100,1,00:01:30.192000,propose that helicopters concentrate on middle of forest that trucks can not reach,2,,210,43,70,42,55
101,3,00:01:46.916000,like you're thinkin #1,2,,210,43,70,42,55
102,4,00:01:57.985000,do you think we should have someone who spots for most of the game and gets what they can or continue as we are,2,,210,43,70,42,55
103,3,00:02:01.660000,I agree with you 0,2,,210,43,70,42,55
104,1,00:02:21.418000,do we want to make houses prio 1 and forest prio 2?,2,,210,43,70,42,55
105,2,00:02:31.591000,Helicopters are quicker so I agree with the middle,2,,210,43,70,42,55
106,4,00:02:33.124000,The trucks can get there its just we arent as fast.,2,,210,43,70,42,55
107,3,00:02:33.609000,Yes because trucks are too slow and could spot and get whatever theyre closet to,2,,210,43,70,42,55
108,2,00:02:56.264000,Since homes are more centralized maybe trucks cover them,2,,210,43,70,42,55
109,1,00:03:05.403000,great idea,2,,210,43,70,42,55
110,2,00:03:05.928000,helicopters can get the forests,2,,210,43,70,42,55
111,1,00:03:30.298000,so in case no fire helis wait over forest and trucks close to cities,2,,210,43,70,42,55
112,2,00:03:31.185000,we just have to watch out because the forests catch fire faster,2,,210,43,70,42,55
113,3,00:03:34.195000,and trucks could come to the forest if helis need backup,2,,210,43,70,42,55
114,3,00:03:42.396000,exactly,2,,210,43,70,42,55
115,4,00:03:46.163000,Ok i think forest should be priority one because there is more area and where the fires mainly pop up. I agree with the trucks on houses statement though,2,,210,43,70,42,55
116,1,00:04:08.611000,fine with me,2,,210,43,70,42,55
117,2,00:04:09.249000,anyone else notice that you can select more than one vehicle?,2,,210,43,70,42,55
118,1,00:04:21.652000,yes,2,,210,43,70,42,55
119,3,00:04:23.688000,yep,2,,210,43,70,42,55
120,4,00:04:25.289000,i did on accident.,2,,210,43,70,42,55
121,2,00:04:40.290000,should we use to our advantage?,2,,210,43,70,42,55
122,4,00:05:05.814000,Nah. We did well enough the first run through.,2,,210,43,70,42,55
123,2,00:05:12.046000,K,2,,210,43,70,42,55
124,1,00:05:22.203000,ok #3,2,,210,43,70,42,55
125,3,00:05:24.190000,is anyone else's connecting lines to vehicles?,2,,210,43,70,42,55
126,4,00:05:55.439000,Not sure what you mean,2,,210,43,70,42,55
127,2,00:06:00.302000,Me neither,2,,210,43,70,42,55
128,2,00:06:23.252000,And looking at this map there's a lot more houses than last round,2,,210,43,70,42,55
129,3,00:06:35.015000,if i click on a truck and then click on a heli it connects a green line to the two of them. almost like connect the dots,2,,210,43,70,42,55
130,4,00:06:53.420000,Should we divide the trucks or keep them on the sid with the most houses or put one on each big town,2,,210,43,70,42,55
131,3,00:07:04.521000,i like the idea of dividing them,2,,210,43,70,42,55
132,1,00:07:23.905000,dividing sounds good,2,,210,43,70,42,55
133,4,00:07:25.320000,Ok so where do we put them?,2,,210,43,70,42,55
134,3,00:07:43.406000,I'll take the town on the bottom left,2,,210,43,70,42,55

137,2,00:08:03.127000,also pay attention that there is not really a close water tower to the town on the right,2,,210,43,70,42,55
138,4,00:08:43.195000,Yeah that sucks. but ill holler if i need help,2,,210,43,70,42,55
139,1,00:08:47.142000,I could cover the top right area with my heli again as prio 1 and then help out,2,,210,43,70,42,55
140,4,00:09:01.572000,Its what ever,2,,210,43,70,42,55
