101,4,00:03:20.877000,i can position directly east on that village,2,6.0,238,43,80,54,61
102,2,00:03:31.636000,and if a big fire erupts they can always move just try not to venture too far from the forest,2,,238,43,80,54,61
103,3,00:03:50.099000,so in other words you guard right side i take left side,2,6.0,238,43,80,54,61
