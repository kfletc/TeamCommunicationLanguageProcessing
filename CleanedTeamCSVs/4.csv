52,3.0,1.0,00:14:40.695000,I wonder if the fire engines move any differently.,1.0,150,61,22,26,41
53,,4.0,00:14:55.387000,they'd kind of be in trouble with the fire in the middle,1.0,150,61,22,26,41
54,,2.0,00:00:26.166000,it works!!!!!,2.0,150,61,22,26,41

59,,2.0,00:01:17.466000,nope,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
60,,3.0,00:01:18.229000,60% forest saved i think,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
61,,4.0,00:01:21.114000,no but it looked like half the place was burned,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
62,,3.0,00:01:45.793000,and 40% houses saved,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
63,,1.0,00:01:47.833000,Yeah I didn't think it was because we lacked info or organization though.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
64,,4.0,00:01:50.352000,so how can we do better?,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
65,,1.0,00:02:03.481000,I wasn't watching the wind direction/speed I'll do that this time.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
66,,4.0,00:02:08.851000,me too,2.0,150,61,22,26,41

68,,3.0,00:02:39.479000,yeah try to concentrate on leading edge,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
69,,1.0,00:02:51.486000,Okay will do.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
70,,4.0,00:02:55.922000,I think going for the edges definitely helps more than going for the middle of the fire,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
71,,4.0,00:03:09.321000,should we divide up areas?,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
72,6.0,3.0,00:03:14.692000,um we each control two engines and two helos,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
73,,4.0,00:03:27.158000,I thought we did better with more than one person o a fire,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
74,,1.0,00:03:32.538000,Yeah? I'm only controlling one it looks like.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41

78,,2.0,00:04:41.987000,i can select all  4,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
79,,3.0,00:04:45.480000,you can deselect and select more than one vehicle,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
80,,1.0,00:04:46.149000,Oh and it seems like the fires start in the forest more often than the houses.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
81,,4.0,00:05:09.566000,true,2.0,150,61,22,26,41

91,4.0,4.0,00:06:17.597000,I think we did better working on the same fires,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
92,,3.0,00:06:32.877000,that works until the fires become to big then we need help,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
93,,4.0,00:06:54.886000,and I think it helps to tell each othe once we spot a fire,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
94,,1.0,00:07:00.617000,Okay.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
95,6.0,3.0,00:07:25.299000,we should try to stick to a water tower each to cut down on resonse time then if the fire is too big help each other out,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
96,6.0,4.0,00:07:46.741000,I'll take the top right tower,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
97,6.0,1.0,00:07:48.515000,That's good. And we should return to the water tower each time.,2.0,150,61,22,26,41
