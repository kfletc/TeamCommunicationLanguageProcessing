1,6.0,4,00:02:28.428000,You have to scroll the screen.,0,127,19,44,41,23
2,3.0,2,00:03:33.760000,Oh nice thank you,0,127,19,44,41,23

4,,2,00:05:25.273000,So this training map is pretty small?,0,127,19,44,41,23
5,,3,00:05:50.752000,Yes it is.,0,127,19,44,41,23
6,,4,00:06:33.987000,Should make it easier to divide up right?,0,127,19,44,41,23
7,3.0,2,00:06:55.168000,Makes sense,0,127,19,44,41,23
8,,1,00:06:58.842000,yea divide in fours?,0,127,19,44,41,23
9,,3,00:07:33.896000,I see four sections just like on the training video...,0,127,19,44,41,23
10,,4,00:08:03.246000,Yep,0,127,19,44,41,23
11,6.0,3,00:08:12.019000,However it may be better to have a team of two for the upper left sections,0,127,19,44,41,23
12,6.0,2,00:08:30.162000,It might also make sense to hang out in the middle and send a couple units to the fires? Lots of strategies i bet,0,127,19,44,41,23
13,6.0,1,00:08:43.259000,and both teams cover this middle area?,0,127,19,44,41,23
14,,3,00:08:59.693000,Perhaps,0,127,19,44,41,23
15,6.0,2,00:08:59.987000,Hang out in your quad but kinda near the middle just another strategy im throwing out there,0,127,19,44,41,23
16,,1,00:09:25.727000,i like the hang out towards the middle and cover your quad if needed,0,127,19,44,41,23
17,,4,00:09:42.494000,Yeah quads have water tanks but the middle doesn't,0,127,19,44,41,23
18,3.0,2,00:09:58.973000,Big papa can only hold so much water so i know ill need help haha,0,127,19,44,41,23
19,,2,00:00:14.252000,Hey yall do we wanna divide up into quads?,1,127,19,44,41,23
20,6.0,3,00:00:27.385000,elsie will take the bottom right quad,1,127,19,44,41,23
21,6.0,2,00:00:44.196000,Big papa will look after the top right,1,127,19,44,41,23
22,6.0,4,00:00:49.510000,I will take the bottom left,1,127,19,44,41,23
23,6.0,1,00:00:56.735000,elvis will take the top right,1,127,19,44,41,23
24,3.0,3,00:01:11.860000,We have larger water tanks,1,127,19,44,41,23
25,6.0,2,00:01:51.424000,Since elvis is top right i will take top left,1,127,19,44,41,23
26,,2,00:03:07.902000,We found if ya fill up and hang out toward the middle of your quad u can help others out faster,1,127,19,44,41,23
27,3.0,3,00:03:15.758000,what is the watertank size on the firetrucks?,1,127,19,44,41,23

30,3.0,2,00:03:41.707000,Think helicopters are faster to make up for it,1,127,19,44,41,23

58,,3,00:00:07.048000,Much larger map area,2,127,19,44,41,23
59,,2,00:00:13.032000,Big papa here,2,127,19,44,41,23
60,6.0,4,00:00:43.797000,The first question ask how did we ask for information,2,127,19,44,41,23
61,,3,00:01:05.085000,What do you mean?,2,127,19,44,41,23
62,6.0,1,00:01:25.855000,We just told each other what we thought was best,2,127,19,44,41,23
63,6.0,4,00:01:29.428000,The guided discussion questions... the first one asks how did we pass on information,2,127,19,44,41,23
64,,4,00:01:59.306000,agreed we kind of did the same thing for passing on information,2,127,19,44,41,23
65,,4,00:02:19.829000,and we were organized by quads on the map,2,127,19,44,41,23
66,,3,00:02:34.019000,which might not have been the best thing to have done^,2,127,19,44,41,23
67,6.0,2,00:02:40.634000,I think most people offered suggestions and we accepted them dont think a lot of questions were asked last game,2,127,19,44,41,23
68,,1,00:03:03.371000,agreed,2,127,19,44,41,23
69,,2,00:03:17.737000,Here's a question: how many units can everyone control? i can control 2 copters and 2 trucks from what i can tell,2,127,19,44,41,23
70,,4,00:03:35.130000,The next question asks if there were any alternatives to our chosen procedure,2,127,19,44,41,23
71,,3,00:03:56.264000,Yes lets all use four vehicles if we can get away with it.,2,127,19,44,41,23
72,,3,00:04:02.412000,:),2,127,19,44,41,23
73,,2,00:04:17.689000,Probably,2,127,19,44,41,23
74,6.0,4,00:04:20.865000,are you deselecting one vehicle before using another?,2,127,19,44,41,23
75,,2,00:04:35.464000,Yes,2,127,19,44,41,23
76,6.0,3,00:04:35.700000,no click and drag over them all,2,127,19,44,41,23
77,6.0,3,00:04:52.843000,(if you want to use them all together),2,127,19,44,41,23
78,6.0,1,00:05:08.191000,Do you think it would be better if we had the fire trucks closer to the larger villages because when fire breaks out there it spreads fast but they are slower and carry more water  and the water tower is closer,2,127,19,44,41,23
79,,2,00:05:17.871000,Last game i only focused on 1 unit this time ill try to use all ,2,127,19,44,41,23
80,,4,00:05:18.667000,okay so if we are able to use multiple vehicles... for the next gam,2,127,19,44,41,23
81,,2,00:05:30.049000,That sounds good trucks near villages,2,127,19,44,41,23
82,,1,00:05:31.779000,opters can keep closer eye on the forests because they are faster,2,127,19,44,41,23
83,,3,00:05:39.590000,sounds good,2,127,19,44,41,23
84,6.0,1,00:06:29.347000,obviously if something huge breaks out though we can fill in and help but be ready for it to pop up on the other side of the map at the same time,2,127,19,44,41,23
85,,4,00:06:39.451000,yeah,2,127,19,44,41,23
86,6.0,2,00:06:44.024000,Also i think wind direction/speed shows us how the fire will spread so im assuming if you take out the fires in the direction of the spread first the damage will be minimized,2,127,19,44,41,23
87,,3,00:06:54.926000,Do yall want to do quads again? (and the same quads)?,2,127,19,44,41,23
88,6.0,2,00:07:12.423000,Sure big papa will look after the top left,2,127,19,44,41,23
89,6.0,4,00:07:24.770000,Yeah I will do bottom left again,2,127,19,44,41,23
90,6.0,2,00:07:56.278000,I'll leave one truck by the village to the right,2,127,19,44,41,23
91,6.0,4,00:08:05.551000,I'll leave two,2,127,19,44,41,23
92,,2,00:08:30.747000,About 1.5minutes until the game starts,2,127,19,44,41,23
93,,3,00:08:36.067000,Have yall seen fires break out in villages? or is it only when a forest fire jumps over?,2,127,19,44,41,23
94,,4,00:08:44.276000,There are houses in the forrest now,2,127,19,44,41,23
95,,2,00:08:52.330000,Good question i am not sure,2,127,19,44,41,23
96,6.0,1,00:09:06.531000,leave one helipcopter or truck full near your area and one by the water tower so while one is filling up you can take the other,2,127,19,44,41,23
97,,4,00:09:20.038000,That's a good strategy,2,127,19,44,41,23
98,3.0,2,00:09:34.432000,These fires dont have a chance this game ><,2,127,19,44,41,23
99,,1,00:09:37.864000,i saw a fire start in the village on my quad last time,2,127,19,44,41,23

105,,3,00:12:09.339000,it may be better to use all 4 vehicles together,3,127,19,44,41,23
106,6.0,3,00:13:27.992000,Do yall want to chat when yall need help? we can all only see a portion of the map area,3,127,19,44,41,23
107,6.0,4,00:13:51.361000,If you use the roller thing on your mouse you can zoom out and see the whole map,3,127,19,44,41,23
108,6.0,1,00:13:59.116000,if you scroll out you can see the entire map,3,127,19,44,41,23
