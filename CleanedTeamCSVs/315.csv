53,1,00:00:19.390000,Question A?,2,,141,56,48,24,13
54,2,00:00:25.489000,Did we pass info well?,2,,141,56,48,24,13
55,1,00:00:45.395000,We didn't really ask questions much but I think we passed it along effectively enough.,2,,141,56,48,24,13
56,3,00:00:52.970000,we called out any fire that was out of control or too far away,2,,141,56,48,24,13
57,2,00:01:13.256000,I think we could have been more organized if we played this all the time. Your thoughts?,2,,141,56,48,24,13
58,1,00:01:24.616000,We didn't have much of a strategy that first time though. It broke down after a few fired.,2,,141,56,48,24,13

61,2,00:02:04.019000,What can we do differently? Or do we....wing it?,2,,141,56,48,24,13
62,3,00:02:25.425000,the trucks need to stay closer to the water towers then the choppers do,2,,141,56,48,24,13
63,1,00:02:26.048000,Maybe this time we can break the map up into halves and have one of each type of vehicle work together per half.,2,,141,56,48,24,13
64,1,00:02:42.777000,I got the impression that trucks had a higher water capacity.,2,,141,56,48,24,13
65,2,00:02:54.145000,yes but they are slower,2,,141,56,48,24,13
66,1,00:02:56.595000,Copters were faster I think but held less.,2,,141,56,48,24,13
