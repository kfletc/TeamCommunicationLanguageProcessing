need to decide on filtering common words or mispellings

	for team performance classification
		average turn taking
		total turn taking per team
		message frequency per team
		total positive sentiment rating **
		total negative sentiment rating **
		total neutral sentiment rating per team **
		total compound sentiment rating per team ?? **
		total feature words per team **
		total parts of speech features per team
		turn taking per simulation
		
	for individual performance classification
		individual turn taking
		individual message frequency
		individual positive sentiment rating **
		individual negative sentiment rating **
		individual neutral sentiment rating **
		individual compound sentiment rating?? **
		total feature words from individual
		total part of speech features from individual
		turn taking per simulation from individual
		
	for individual generation of SA score on a message
		message sentiment rating in all categories **
		feature words from message **
		total part of speech features from message
		message length??
		
		attempt to classify each SA score individually against all others + none so that ones with two won't hurt classification scores
		may attempt to filter out messages without SA score and attempt classifying just the ones with against each others
